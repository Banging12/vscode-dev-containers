# Dev Container for vscode-dev-containers

This folder includes a configuration for building dev containers or reviewing PRs inside of another dev container - "Inception" style ðŸ˜Ž. It includes the Moby/Docker and a desktop with VS Code stable, insiders, and the Remote - Containers extension installed for quick testing of local scenarios when needed.

The desktop is auto-forwarded via HTTP to port 6080 and the login password is `vscode`.

However, most likely, this was not what you were looking for when you came to this repository. Actual dev container definitions can be found [under the `/containers` folder](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers) in this repository.
